This was a great help. I applied this method to similiar problem and rather than concat a SELECT statement I created an event scheduled every couple hours to rebuild a view that pivots n amount of rows from one table into n columns on the other. It is a big help because before I was rebuilding the query using PHP on every execution of the SELECT. Even though views can not leverage Indexes, I am thinking filtering performance will not be an issue as the pivoted rows->columns represent types of training employees at a franchise have so the view will not ever break a few thousand rows.
